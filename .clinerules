[LEARNING_JOURNAL]
- Regularly updating memory_bank and any instruction files help me to remember what I have done and what still needs to be done so I don't lose track.
- The browser_action tool uses a fixed viewport (900x600), making direct testing of mobile-specific CSS media queries difficult. Visual inspection for mobile issues might require alternative approaches or focusing on elements that are present but styled differently.
- Persistent JavaScript errors (like the UX Mirror loader issue) should be prioritized as they can have cascading effects on other page functionalities.
