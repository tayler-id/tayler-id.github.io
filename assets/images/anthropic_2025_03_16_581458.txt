04:39 PM | Fin: We understand your financial concerns. Unfortunately, we don't offer general financial assistance programs for API usage. However, there are a few options you could consider: 
 1. If you're a researcher, you might be eligible for our External Researcher Access Program. You can apply through our application form for potential free API credits. 
2. For startups in specific circumstances, we have limited programs handled by our sales team. You can reach out through our Contact Sales form to explore potential opportunities. 
3. As you continue using our API, your usage limits may automatically increase over time, potentially offering better value. 
 For more tailored solutions, consider contacting our sales team through the Contact Sales form on our website to discuss your specific situation and explore any available options.

04:56 PM | Tayler Ramsay: My name is Tayler Ramsay, and I have been engaged in AI development research for the past two years. Recently, I have been leveraging Claude to build innovative startups, including a mental health pattern detection application that I believe stands apart in its ability to offer accessible support to those in need. 
 My passion for this work is deeply personal. Over the past year, both my wife and daughter have battled severe mental depression, with each requiring over six months of hospitalization. These experiences have not only intensified my commitment to mental health care but have also brought significant financial challenges, as the costs associated with this work have now exceeded $1700. Balancing the demands of supporting my family and advancing this project has become increasingly difficult. 
 I am reaching out to explore whether there might be any opportunities for support or collaboration with Anthropic that could help sustain my efforts in this vital area. I am more than willing to share my work and collaborate on advancing solutions that empower individuals unable to access traditional mental health care. 
 Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. I look forward to any guidance or support you may be able to offer. 
 Sincerely, 
 Tayler Ramsay

04:58 PM | Tayler Ramsay: Most of that $1700 was over February and March. I hope this does not come off as someone looking for pity. I am not I am just very passionate about this.
